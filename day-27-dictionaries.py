# Python dictionaries
# Coded on 24.10.2022
# Dictionary in python is similar to dictionary in real life
# For example if we want to find the definition of a word in the dictionary
# The word that we want to look up for is the "key", while the definition is the "Value"
# To create a dictionary, the basic syntax: {key: Value}
# {"Bug": "An error in a program that prevent the program from running as expected."}

# If more than 1 entry in the dictionary, we use comma to separate the entries:
# {
#     "Bug": "An error in a program that prevent the program from running as expected.",
#     "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
#     "Loop": "The action of doing something over and over again."
# }

# A dictionary can be stored in a variable:
programming_dictionary = {
    "Bug": "An error in a program that prevent the program from running as expected.",
    "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
}

# To retrieve an item in a dictionary:
print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])

# Adding a new item into the dictionary:
programming_dictionary["Loop"] = "The action of doing something over and over again."

# Same way as we create an empty list, we can do the same with dictionary:
empty_list = []
empty_dictionary = {}

# Wipe an existing dictionary:
# programming_dictionary = {}

# Edit an item in a dictionary
programming_dictionary["Bug"] = "A moth in your computer."
print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])

# Loop through a dictionary
for key in programming_dictionary:
    print(key)
    print(programming_dictionary[key])


# Day 9 / Exercise 1 - Grading Program
student_scores = {
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
  "Neville": 62,
}
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#TODO-1: Create an empty dictionary called student_grades.
student_grades = {}

#TODO-2: Write your code below to add the grades to student_grades.ğŸ‘‡
# This is the scoring criteria:
#     Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
#     Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
#     Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
#     Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
# my_solution:
# for key in student_scores:
#     if student_scores[key] > 90:
#         student_scores[key] = "Outstanding"
#     elif student_scores[key] > 80:
#         student_scores[key] = "Exceeds Expectations"
#     elif student_scores[key] > 70:
#         student_scores[key] = "Acceptable"
#     else:
#         student_scores[key] = "Fail"
#     student_grades[key] = student_scores[key]

# udemy solution:
for student in student_scores:
    score = student_scores[student]
    if score > 90:
        student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
    elif score > 80:
        student_grades[student] = "Exceeds Expectations"
    elif score > 70:
        student_grades[student] = "Acceptable"
    else:
        student_grades[student] = "Fail"
