# 91. The Python dictionary: Deep Dive
# Coded on 24.10.2022
# Dictionary in python is similar to dictionary in real life
# For example if we want to find the definition of a word in the dictionary
# The word that we want to look up for is the "key", while the definition is the "Value"
# To create a dictionary, the basic syntax: {key: Value}
# {"Bug": "An error in a program that prevent the program from running as expected."}

# If more than 1 entry in the dictionary, we use comma to separate the entries:
# {
#     "Bug": "An error in a program that prevent the program from running as expected.",
#     "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
#     "Loop": "The action of doing something over and over again."
# }

# A dictionary can be stored in a variable:
programming_dictionary = {
    "Bug": "An error in a program that prevent the program from running as expected.",
    "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
}

# To retrieve an item in a dictionary:
print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])

# Adding a new item into the dictionary:
programming_dictionary["Loop"] = "The action of doing something over and over again."

# Same way as we create an empty list, we can do the same with dictionary:
empty_list = []
empty_dictionary = {}

# Wipe an existing dictionary:
# programming_dictionary = {}

# Edit an item in a dictionary
programming_dictionary["Bug"] = "A moth in your computer."
print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])

# Loop through a dictionary
for key in programming_dictionary:
    print(key)
    print(programming_dictionary[key])

#TODO-2: Write your code below to add the grades to student_grades.ðŸ‘‡
# This is the scoring criteria:
#     Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
#     Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
#     Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

#         student_scores[key] = "Outstanding"
#     elif student_scores[key] > 80:
#         student_scores[key] = "Exceeds Expectations"
#     elif student_scores[key] > 70:

# 93. Nesting Lists and Dictionaries

# A dictionary looks like this: {Key: Value} where each Key contains one Value
capitals = {
    "France": "Paris",
    "Germany": "Berlin",
}

# A dictionary with a nested list and dictionary looks like this:
# {
# Key: Value1,
# Key2: [List],
# Key3: {Dict},
# }

# Nesting a list in a Dictionary:
travel_log = {
    "France": ["Paris", "Nice", "Monaco"],
    "Germany": ["Berlin", "Frankfurt", "Munich", "Stuttgart", "Wurzburg", "Ulm"],
}

# Nesting a list in a list is not quite useful compared to a nested dictionary:
# ["A", "B", ["C", "D"]]

# Nesting a Dictionary in a Dictionary
travel_log = {
    "France": {
        "cities_visited": [

            "Ulm"],
        "total_visits": 24
    },
