    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(A): Probability of being a user (prevalence of drug users in the population) = 0.003 (0.3% of the population)\n",
    "    P(B∣A): Probability of testing positive given that the person is a user (sensitivity) = 0.99 (99% accurate for users)\n",
    "    P(B∣¬A): Probability of testing positive given that the person is not a user (false positive rate) = 0.01 (1% error for non-users)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A∣B) = ( P(B∣A) ⋅ P(A) ) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "P(B) = P(B∣A) ⋅ P(A) + P(B∣¬A) ⋅ P(¬A)\n",
    "\n",
    "And P(¬A) is the probability of not being a user, which is equal to 1 − P(A).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's plug in the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = (0.99 ⋅ 0.003) + (0.01 ⋅ 0.997)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = 0.00297 + 0.00997\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = 0.01294\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A∣B) = (0.99 ⋅ 0.0030)/ 0.01294 \n",
    "\n",
    "P(A∣B) = 0.00297 / 0.01294\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A∣B) ≈ 0.229\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given a positive test result, the probability of the person actually being a user is approximately 22.9%. Despite the test's high accuracy, the low prevalence of drug users in the overall population contributes to a relatively low positive predictive value."

    "**Let's break down the solution step by step:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a population, and in that population, only 0.3% of people actually use a particular drug. This is our P(A) or the probability of being a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a drug test that's pretty accurate:\n",

    "    It correctly identifies users 99% of the time (P(B∣A)).\n",
    "    It correctly gives a negative result for non-users 99% of the time (P(B∣¬A)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the Bayes' Theorem helps us understand the probability of someone being a user given a positive test result. This is P(A∣B).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Calculate the total probability of getting a positive result (P(B)):\n",
    "        This involves considering both scenarios:\n",
    "            A person is a user (P(B∣A) × P(A))\n",
    "            A person is not a user (P(B∣¬A) × P(¬A))\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = P(B∣A) ⋅ P(A) + P(B∣¬A) ⋅ P(¬A)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Use Bayes' Theorem to find P(A∣B):\n",
    "        Bayes' Theorem takes into account the likelihood of being a user given a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A∣B) = ( P(B∣A) ⋅ P(A) ) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, even if the test is very accurate, the low prevalence of drug users in the overall population means that even a small percentage of false positives can significantly affect the probability of someone actually being a user when the test is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case, with a positive test result, there's approximately a 22.9% chance that the person is actually a user. This might seem counterintuitive at first, but it's a result of the interplay between the test accuracy and the low prevalence of drug users in the population."
