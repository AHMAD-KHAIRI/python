# for example water that is filling in a bath tub: 
# water_level = 50
# if water_level > 80:
#   print("Drain water")

# Exercise #1: Rollercoaster ride height
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

# Check if the height is greater than 120cm to play the rollercoaster
if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
# make sure that else is not indented over but must be placed the same indent as the if statement
else:
    print("Sorry, you have to be taller than 120cm to ride the rollercoaster! ")
