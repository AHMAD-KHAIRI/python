# 50. Using the for loop with Python Lists
# Coded on 19.09.2022

fruits = ["Apples", "Peach", "Pear"]

# To access each item in the list indvidually and print it out one-by-one, we use for loop
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# for loop assigns the variable name "fruit" to each of the item in the list
# fruit = Apples then print
# fruit = Peach then print
# fruit = Pear then print

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")

# indentation after the colon is important
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")
    print(fruits)
print(fruits)
